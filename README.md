Check out my portfolio here : https://starlit-wisp-1f8a08.netlify.app/

This is my completed Portfolio website, that I will use to apply for jobs once I've completed and add my projects to it. I designed and developed this website myself with React, HTML and CSS/SCSS. I used a variety of packages to complete this project including React-Router,React-scroll and email-js.

### What I did different 
I really wanted to add my resume as a page so that employers can quickly view my details directly from my website. But I did'nt want it to be just a standard resume layout. So I added the ablity to close and open sections of my resume so that it was easier to navigate it or read specific sections at a time.

## Take a look 
I aimed to create a smooth and coherently styled web page that looks sleek and modern. Keeping the grey,white and blue them along with soft edges helped create a tailwind-esque feel.

## Add Email-Js
To create my contact form I used Email-JS which was super simple to get going and link to my email account right away.
